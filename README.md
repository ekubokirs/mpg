Track Yo' Gas(working name)

Problem to be Solved:
Keeping track of gas milage (in MPG) can be hard since most people don't tend to travel with their computers to immediately update to see how they can be more efficient.

MVP
1. User can register
2. User can log in
3. User can add a car
4. User can log a tank of gas
5. Graph displaying user's MPG shows on dashboard

Milestones
1. Set up base app with rspec and postgresql
2. ERB for login/landing page (make really pretty)
3. Set up authorization and password reset and with rspec
4. Set up form pages with options for select based on cars etc.
5. work on D3 or other graph capabilities to show MPG over time
6. ERB page design for dashboard with graph

Future Plans
1. Chart differences in MPG based on weather
2. Users can export data
3. Allow user to see different information displayed graphically
4. Add accessibility features

User Stories
To start tracking MPG, as the user, I must be able to register
To track useage, as the user, I must be able to enter the details of my car
To add a trip, as the user, I must be able to enter the cost and milage
To use my past information in reality, as the user, I must be able to see the information graphically
To see what else alter MPG, as a user, I must be able to checkoff driving conditions (ie traffic)
Because I could forget my password, as a user, I must be able to reset my password

Future User Stories
To see how the season alters MPG, as the user, I must be able to comment on weather conditions
To manipulate the data the way I want to see it, as the user, I should be able to export the data I logged
To best use my data, as the user, I should be able to pick the metrics I want to compare
